You can see the website on this [KCV](http://kcv.if.its.ac.id)
   ### 1.1 Bad Things
   - **Top Navbar**<br>
   While on the **"Halaman Utama"**, on the top navbar, menu that has active effect is the **"Language Switcher"**. Even though the active effect should be **"Halaman Utama"**.
   - **Image Slider**<br>
   The button on the slider image doesn't work, so it's useless. Then when the image is clicked, nothing appears, only refreshes the page.
   - **Image in Table**<br>
   In the organizational structure table, there are differences in displaying photos. some have a box shape, some have a round shape, and some have different background.

   ### 3.1 Bad Things
   - **Content Ratio**<br>
   Lots of empty space. The contents only fill a small portion of the width.
   - **Too Many Colors**<br>
   The color used is too much, and not suitable with the background.
   - **Too Many Moving Objects**<br>
   The objects contained on this page are very numerous, and move. Things like this can make people who see their website become annoyed, including me.
   ### 3.2 Suggestion
   Actually I can't give it an suggestion, because the bad things in this website maybe was the concept on their website to attract many people and give nostalgic sensation to people who open their website.
   ### 3.3 Demo
   (soon)
